Day 21: AI Chat Bot Project Completed! ðŸ¤–

I've wrapped up my 21-day challenge with a bang, creating a fully functional AI Chat Bot using Google Gemini. From prompt engineering to API key generation, I've covered every step of the process.

Key Highlights:

End-to-End Project: A comprehensive journey from idea to execution.
Google Gemini: Leveraged the power of Google's advanced AI model.
Prompt Engineering: Crafted effective prompts to guide the AI's responses.
Python Libraries: Utilized dotenv, streamlit, OS (for system interaction), and google.generativeai to build the chatbot's functionality.
